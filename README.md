# SWIMCAT-Cloud-image-classification

## About
This project is about predicting the type of cloud or sky using the machine learning models training on the SWIMCAT dataset

## Usage
To use this project, you just need to download the file and run it on any IDEs or platforms that you like since this project does not need the GPU usage.

## Details
In this project, we will implement steps as below:
- Preprocessing the data:
  - Image resizing
  - Horizontally flip
  - Pixels' value normalization

- Feature extraction:
  - Color histogram
  - GLCM
  - LBP
  - Haralick
  - HOG

- Feature selection:
  - Standard Scaler
  - Random Forrest
  - PCA

- In this project, we will be using 4 different models:
  - Random Forest
  - SVM
  - KNN
  - Ensemble method (combination of Random Forest, SVM and KNN)
